## 1D-kMQC: A set of reciprocal-space MQC codes for 1-D lattice models of electron-phonon scattering. 

This codebase includes an implementation of mean-field (MF) [1] and surface hopping (FSSH) [2] methods
for 1-D lattices consisting of nearest-neighbor interactions with electron-phonon couplings modeled as either 
Holstein or Peierls interactions. These codes can be used to reproduce the calculations performed in [3]
and [4] for the mean-field (MF) and fewest-switches surface hopping (FSSH) methods respectively.
